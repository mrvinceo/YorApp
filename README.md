# YorApp
Exploratory App Project for York Visitors

## Purpose
To explore potential weather- and geo-location-based York visitor app for advertising/reviewing attractions, shops and establishments, to 
re-categorise listings according to weather forecast, based on weather.io API, and Gmaps location (possibly)

## Makeup
Using Ionic/Cordova for cross-platform app provision.

## Progress notes
Using Drupal as a back end for Content Management. Performance = laggy, look at using Firebase with a basic form-based 
interface for admins. 
Weather connection made, need to specify variables and ranges in temp and type of weather.
